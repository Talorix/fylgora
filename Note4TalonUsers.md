If you are switching from Talon to Fylgora, simply place the `data` folder and `data.json` file in the directory where Fylgora is installed (or will be installed).

You do **not** need to create a new node — doing so will only cause issues with the servers. Just copy the existing node configuration command and paste it into Fylgora directory terminal. You’ll be good to go.
